Certainly, I've added a point about the inclusion of Mediator implementation and CQRS pattern to your README:

# My Project Template for Clean Architecture using .NET Core

This project template is designed for .NET Core and follows the principles of Clean Architecture while incorporating Entity Framework Core. It provides a modular foundation to develop robust and maintainable .NET Core applications.

## Key Features

- **Clean Architecture**: Adheres to the principles of Clean Architecture by organizing responsibilities into layers: API/UI, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Integrates with Entity Framework Core for data access, allowing the use of various databases.
- **Swagger API Documentation**: Includes Swagger UI to facilitate API documentation.
- **Dependency Injection**: Leverages the built-in Dependency Injection capabilities of .NET Core for dependency management.
- **Mediator Implementation**: Implements the Mediator pattern for handling commands and queries.
- **CQRS Pattern**: Adopts the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern for separation of concerns in application logic.
- **Configuration Management**: Manages configuration settings through `appsettings.json` and environment variables.

## Prerequisites

- .NET Core 6
